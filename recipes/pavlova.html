    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Egg Whites</li>
        <li>2 Cups Caster Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp Vanilla Essence</li>
        <li>1 tsp White Vinegar</li>
        <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
        <li>2 tsp Cornflour</li>
        <li>300ml Whipped Cream</li>
        <li>Fruit to Decorate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 110ÂºC bake (not fan bake). Line a baking tray with baking paper.

            In a large metal, ceramic or glass bowl (not plastic), beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Continue beating while adding the Chelsea Caster Sugar a quarter of a cup at a time. The mixture should get
            glossier and thicker with each addition and this should take at least 10 minutes. Beat in the vanilla,
            vinegar and Edmonds Fielder's Cornflour.</li>
        <li>Spoon mixture out onto the prepared tray into a dinner plate sized mound.</li>
        <li>Bake for approximately 1 1/2 hours, until dry and crisp and it lifts easily off the baking paper. Turn the
            oven off and leave the pavlova for at least an hour before removing from the oven. Finish cooling on a wire
            rack, then transfer to an airtight container.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, place on a serving plate, swirl the top with the whipped Meadow Fresh Original Cream
            and decorate with sliced or chopped fruit of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
